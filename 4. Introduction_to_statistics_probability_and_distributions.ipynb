    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the realm of data, probabilities and distributions are extremely important. These concepts will provide a vital basis when moving on to related technical fields such as machine learning, modelling, and algorithmic development.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics can be broken down into two avenues - Descriptive & Inferential. The best comparison between the two is described in Keone Hon's *Introduction to Statistics* - \"Descriptive statistics is used to say something about a set of information that has been collected only. Inferential statistics is used to make predictions or comparisons about a larger group (a population) using information gathered about a small part of that population. Thus, inferential statistics involves generalizing beyond the data, something that descriptive statistics does not do.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So think of descriptive stats as how we describe data (mean, mode and median, for example) and inferential statistics as how we can make assumptions using the data (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal Data\n",
    " - 1.1 Binary Data - two distinct data types (yes/no or true/false)\n",
    " - 1.2 Categorical Data -  many data types (primary/secondary/tertiary)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Ordinal Data - a number used in scoring that implies an order. An example is a rank from 0 to 5 (this is considered categorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Continous Data (Interval data) - variable with any number (Blood pressure or seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Discrete Variables - variables which hold a whole number; can be used as a counting number (Number of Explore graduates who have been placed into jobs)"

    "Are a little more tricky, conceptually. For discrete variables, the probability mass function tells us directly the probability of individual outcomes, or (by summing) of groups of outcomes. \n",
    "For example, the PMF for the roll of a die is $p(x) = 1/6$ for $x \\in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. We can see directly that there is a one-in-six chance of rolling a three, or a 50% chance $(1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6)$ of rolling a four or above. But for continuous random variables, the probability of achieving a very specific outcome is in fact zero. This sounds a little counter-intuitive, I know, but it has to do with the infinite divisibility of outcomes. \n",
    "Therefore, for a continuous random variable, we must think in terms of the probability of achieving an outcome between two limits. For example, for the 400m world record, we could think of the probability of Wayde van Niekerk running another 43.03 second race, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second, as the probability of time between 43.025 and 43.035 seconds."

Probabilities for continuous variables are found by integration, which is after all the continuous analogue to summation, and this condition enforces that the integral of the probability densities over all possible values of $x$ comes to 1, as necessary for a valid probability distribution. To continue with our 400m example, we would evaluate the probability we're after by integrating between 43.025 and 43.035 seconds. We'd find the probability of Wayde breaking his own world record by integrating over the interval 0 (or negative infinity, but negative times are of course not possible so we can safely ignore this part of the real number line) to 43.025 seconds."

The binomial distribution PMF above is simply the generalisation of this logic to any $n$, $x$ and $p$.\n",

    "Suppose once again that we have a binomial process, where each trial is either a success or a failure. If we let $X$ represent the number of failures that occur before we hit a specific number of successes, usually denoted $r$, and $p$ is the probability of success on each trial, then $X \\sim NB(r,p)$, i.e. $X$ follows the negative binomial distribution with parameters $r$ and $p$ and has PMF:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p(x) & = \\binom{x+r-1}{x} p^r (1-p)^{x} & & \\text{for } x = 0, 1, \\ldots, n\\\\\n",
    "     & = 0 & & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "You can derive this PMF in a similar way to the approach we took for the binomial distribution. Intuitively, each possible path that takes us to $r$ successes and $x$ failures must have probability $p^r (1-p)^x$. How many such combinations are there? Well, remember first of all that by our definition, the last trial must have been a success, so in the previous $x+r-1$ trials we will have had $x$ failures. There are $\\binom{x+r-1}{x}$ ways of arranging these\n",
    "$x$ failures and $r-1$ successes.\n",

    "### Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal, or Gaussian, distribution is hugely important in statistical and data science work (although it has its limitations!)- one of its primary applications is in what's known as the Central Limit Theorem, which we'll refresh our memories about a little later. So it's worth spending a little time to understand it thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A normally distributed variable is continuous, and has PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) ^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $x$ taking on any value on the real number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll immediately have seen (won't you?) that the normal distribution has two parameters, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. These in fact are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution respectively; some of you will already be familiar with these concepts but for those who aren't, don't let it bother you just yet: we'll be explaining those in a little while.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important practical application is the **standard normal distribution**, which has $\\mu =0$ and $\\sigma = 1$, and hence PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\phi(x) = \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is bell-shaped: let's write a little Python code to illustrate that using ```matplotlib```. This time, just for fun, we'll evaluate the density directly from the above equation, rather than using the built-in ```scipy``` functions. But you can easily verify that you get the same results from the latter."

    "Remember that for continuous random variables, to calculate the probability of an outcome in a particular range, we need to use the cumulative distribution function. As we've seen above, this requires integrating the PDF. Unfortunately, there are no analytical solutions to this, but numerical methods can be used (don't worry if the mathematics of numerical integration are outside your range of expertise, as this is beyond our scope at this point; if you're interested, you can get a high-level overview at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration). This has been encoded in handy tables with which you'll no doubt be familiar if you've done any university-level statistics, and of course, Python and `scipy` provide functions for us to evaluate. Let's define a function to calculate the probability of observation following the above distribution lying between arbitrary bounds $x_1$ and $x_2$, and then use that to calculate the probability of observation between 2 and 5. We use the simple logic here that the probability we're after is the probability of observation of less than $x_2$, less the probability of an observation less than $x_1$."

    "\n",
    "## Sampling and Sampling Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is the process of selecting a subset (sample) from a larger set (population) to make inferences about the population. Sampling allows researchers to collect and analyze data without needing to observe the entire population, which is often impractical due to constraints like cost, time, or accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Importance of Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency: Saves time and resources compared to studying an entire population.\n",
    "- Feasibility: Makes data collection manageable and possible in cases where it's otherwise impractical.\n",
    "- Statistical Validity: Enables accurate estimates of population parameters when done correctly, minimizing bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Sampling Methods\n",
    "1. Probability Sampling: Every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected.\n",
    "- Simple Random Sampling: Each member has an equal probability of being chosen.\n",
    "- Systematic Sampling: Selects every kth element from a list after a random start.\n",
    "- Stratified Sampling: Divides the population into strata (subgroups) and samples from each stratum proportionally.\n",
    "- Cluster Sampling: Divides the population into clusters, then randomly selects clusters and samples all members within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-Probability Sampling: Some members of the population may not have a chance of being included.\n",
    "- Convenience Sampling: Samples those easiest to access.\n",
    "- Judgmental (Purposive) Sampling: Involves researcher judgment to select participants.\n",
    "- Quota Sampling: Ensures representation of specific characteristics within the sample.\n",
    "- Snowball Sampling: Used for hard-to-reach populations, where existing participants recruit new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Distributions\n",
    "A sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a given statistic based on a random sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "- if you take multiple samples from a population and calculate the mean for each, the distribution of those means forms the sampling distribution of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "- The shape of the sampling distribution depends on the sample size and the population distribution.\n",
    "- As sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normal due to the **Central Limit Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "is the distribution of the sample mean or other statistics, when the samples are selected randomly from a population. It is used to understand the behavior of a statistic when the samples are randomly selected from a population."

    "# Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the key assumptions in statistical modeling is essential for interpreting results accurately and ensuring that models produce reliable insights. Here's an overview of the strong assumptions commonly associated with many statistical models, including linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Linearity\n",
    "Definition: \n",
    "- Linearity assumes that the relationship between the independent (predictor) variables and the dependent (response) variable is linear. \n",
    "- This means that a change in the independent variable corresponds to a proportional change in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: \n",
    "- This assumption is crucial for models like linear regression because these models aim to fit a linear function to the data. \n",
    "- If the actual relationship is non-linear, using a linear model may lead to biased or misleading results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implications in Statistics: \n",
    "- Linearity simplifies analysis and interpretation, allowing us to make straightforward conclusions about how changes in predictors influence the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Check: \n",
    "- Visualize scatter plots of the independent and dependent variables or use residual plots (the plot of residuals versus predicted values) to see if there is a non-linear pattern. \n",
    "- If there is a curve or trend, the linearity assumption might be violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions if Violated: \n",
    "- Use transformations of the data (e.g., log, square root) or apply non-linear models such as \n",
    "    - polynomial regression, \n",
    "    - decision trees, or \n",
    "    - generalized additive models (GAMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: \n",
    "You are predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and distance from the city center.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are predicting house prices (price) using features like:\n",
    "- square_footage (continuous variable)\n",
    "- num_bedrooms (categorical or discrete variable)\n",
    "- distance_city_center (continuous variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Questions to Ask Yourself\n",
    "- Is there a clear linear relationship between each predictor and the response variable?\n",
    "- Are there signs in the data that suggest a transformation might be needed?\n",
    "- Are there any interactions between variables that could better capture the linear relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnosing Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter Plot: \n",
    "- Plot the dependent variable (e.g., house price) against each independent variable (e.g., square footage). \n",
    "- If you see a curved or non-linear pattern, the assumption of linearity is likely violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual Plot: \n",
    "- Plot the residuals against the predicted values. \n",
    "    - A non-random pattern (e.g., a U-shape) indicates non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform Variables: \n",
    "- Apply transformations like the \n",
    "    - logarithm, \n",
    "    - square root, or \n",
    "    - polynomial terms to make the relationship more linear. \n",
    "        - For example, using log(price) instead of price can sometimes linearize relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Non-linear Models: \n",
    "- Consider models like \n",
    "    - polynomial regression or \n",
    "    - splines if transformations don't suffice. \n",
    "        - For example, a quadratic regression model (y = β₀ + β₁x + β₂x²) can model a parabolic trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply More Flexible Models: \n",
    "- Use machine learning models such as decision trees or gradient boosting models, which do not assume linear relationships.\n",

    "Definition: \n",
    "- The normality assumption states that the residuals (errors) of the model should be normally distributed. \n",
    "- This is less about the distribution of the dependent variable itself and more about the distribution of the errors after fitting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: \n",
    "- Normality of residuals is critical for conducting hypothesis tests and building confidence intervals. \n",
    "- It ensures that the statistical inference drawn from the model (e.g., p-values and confidence intervals) is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implications in Statistics: \n",
    "- If residuals are not normally distributed, the results of hypothesis tests may be unreliable, leading to incorrect conclusions about the significance of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Check: \n",
    "- Use a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot or histogram of residuals to visually inspect normality. \n",
    "- A Q-Q plot that aligns closely with a 45-degree line suggests normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions if Violated: \n",
    "- Apply data transformations (e.g., log or Box-Cox transformations) or use non-parametric methods that do not assume normality, such as\n",
    "    - bootstrapping.\n",

    "### 3. Homoscedasticity\n",
    "Definition: \n",
    "- Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the errors (residuals) is constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). \n",
    "- In other words, the spread of the residuals should be similar regardless of the value of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: \n",
    "- Homoscedasticity ensures that the model provides equally reliable predictions across all values of the independent variables. \n",
    "- Violations can lead to inefficiencies in estimating coefficients and make hypothesis tests less powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implications in Statistics: \n",
    "- If the residuals exhibit increasing or decreasing spread (**heteroscedasticity**), the model might overestimate or underestimate the variability, affecting the accuracy of prediction intervals and standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Check: \n",
    "- Create a residuals versus predicted values plot. If the residuals fan out or show a funnel shape, there is evidence of heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions if Violated: \n",
    "- Use weighted least squares regression or transform the dependent variable to stabilize variance. Robust standard errors can also be used to correct the standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: \n",
    "You're modeling income based on years of experience, and you notice that variability in income widens for higher experience levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnosing Homoscedasticity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Residuals vs. Predicted Values Plot: \n",
    "- If the residuals spread out or narrow as the predicted values increase, you have **heteroscedasticity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breusch-Pagan Test: \n",
    "- Conduct this test to statistically assess heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform Dependent Variable: \n",
    "- Use transformations like log(y) or sqrt(y) to stabilize variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted Least Squares Regression: \n",
    "- Assign weights to data points inversely proportional to their variance, giving less influence to data points with higher variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust Standard Errors: \n",
    "- Use robust methods to adjust standard errors for heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach to Diagnosing and Handling Homoscedasticity\n",
    "1. Initial Inspection: Look for patterns in residuals vs. fitted values.\n",
    "2. Statistical Tests: Confirm findings with the Breusch-Pagan or Goldfeld-Quandt tests.\n",
    "3. Corrective Actions:\n",
    "- Transformations: Log or square root of the dependent variable.\n",
    "- Weighted Regression: Apply weights to stabilize variance.\n",
    "- Robust Models: Use robust standard errors for more reliable inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that your model meets the assumption of homoscedasticity or is adjusted to provide valid statistical inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variable. If the variance increases or decreases systematically, the data is said to be heteroscedastic, which can impact the reliability of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Initial Visual Inspection of Residuals vs. Fitted Values\n",
    "A common first step is to plot the residuals against the fitted (predicted) values to see if there is a pattern."
