    "## Understanding Statistical Models vs. Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential first to understand the distinctions between statistical models and machine learning models, as they serve different purposes, assumptions, and interpretative depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical Models: \n",
    "    - These are rooted in traditional statistics and \n",
    "        - focus on relationships between variables through predefined equations. \n",
    "    - Statistical models aim to understand the underlying data-generating process, focusing on hypothesis testing and inference. \n",
    "    - These models often rely on strong assumptions like:\n",
    "        - linearity, \n",
    "        - normality, and \n",
    "        - homoscedasticity \n",
    "        - and are **interpretable**, making it easier to understand the impact of individual variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine Learning Models: \n",
    "    - These prioritize **predictive** power over interpretability. \n",
    "    - They are designed to automatically learn patterns and relationships within data, often with minimal assumptions. \n",
    "    - Machine learning models can handle complex and high-dimensional data but may lack transparency about how individual features affect the outcome, especially in “black box” models like neural networks or ensemble methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Statistical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of statistical model you use depends on your data and problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression: For predicting a **continuous target variable** based on one or more predictors.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: For predicting a **binary outcomes**, often used in classification problems.\n",
    "- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): For comparing means across multiple groups.\n",
    "- Time Series Models: For data that’s ordered by time (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA).\n",
    "- Survival Analysis: For time-to-event data, such as customer churn timing.\n",
    "- Multivariate Analysis: For understanding interactions across multiple variables (e.g., MANOVA, PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing the Data\n",
    "Prepare your data by cleaning and preprocessing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing Values: Decide whether to impute or drop missing values.\n",
    "- Outliers: Identify and consider handling outliers, especially in regression.\n",
    "- Data Transformation: Transform non-normal variables if required (e.g., using log transformations).\n",
    "- Feature Scaling: For some models, standardizing or normalizing data is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is essential to understand: \n",
    "- patterns,\n",
    "    - visualizations\n",
    "- distributions,\n",
    "    - summary statistics\n",
    "- relationships\n",
    "    - correlation matrices\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is to identify relevant features and spot potential issues like multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Statistical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statsmodels** provides \n",
    "    - coefficients, \n",
    "    - p-values, and \n",
    "    - confidence intervals for each variable, \n",
    "        - enabling hypothesis testing on whether each predictor significantly affects the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating Model Performance\n",
    "Regression Metrics: \n",
    "- Use R-squared, \n",
    "- Adjusted R-squared, \n",
    "- RMSE, and \n",
    "- MAE to evaluate regression models.\n",

    "Residual Analysis: \n",
    "- Residual plots help assess assumptions\n",
    "    - homoscedasticity, \n",
    "    - normality of residuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Interpretation\n",
    "Statistical models are highly interpretable. \n",
    "- In linear regression, each coefficient represents the expected change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the predictor, holding all else constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals: \n",
    "- Look at 95% CI for each coefficient; if it does not contain zero, it suggests the predictor has a statistically significant effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "P-Values: \n",
    "- A p-value below a threshold (usually 0.05) indicates that the predictor significantly affects the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validating Assumptions\n",
    "- Linearity: Check scatter plots of residuals.\n",
    "- Normality of Residuals: Use a Q-Q plot to verify.\n",
    "- No Multicollinearity: Variance inflation factor (VIF) helps detect multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: Plot residuals vs. fitted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reporting and Communicating Results\n",
    "Present your findings by focusing on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Coefficients: Explain which predictors significantly affect the outcome.\n",
    "- Model Fit: Interpret R-squared values (e.g., explaining how much variance in the target variable is explained).\n",
    "- Real-World Implications: Describe how insights from the model can impact business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach to statistical modeling\n",
    "\n",

    "- strengths, and \n",
    "- limitations, \n",
    "\n",
    "Understand when and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define Objectives and Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify the Problem and Objectives: \n",
    "- Clearly define the goal.\n",
    "    - Are you trying to predict, classify, find patterns, or estimate relationships? \n",
    "    - Setting objectives helps in choosing the right model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formulate Hypotheses: \n",
    "    - Based on the problem, develop hypotheses. \n",
    "        - For instance, in a sales prediction problem, you may hypothesize that `certain features like advertising spend, time of year, and economic indicators affect sales.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "Data Collection: \n",
    "- Gather historical data related to the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cleaning: \n",
    "- Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering: \n",
    "- Create new features if necessary. \n",
    "- This could involve \n",
    "    - transformations, \n",
    "    - encoding categorical variables, or \n",
    "    - creating interaction terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Splitting: \n",
    "- Split the data into training and testing sets. Typically, an 80-20 or 70-30 split is used.\n",

    "## Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is EDA important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps us to understand our data without making any assumptions. EDA is a vital component before we continue with the modelling phase as it provides context and guidance on the course of action to take when developing the appropriate model. It will also assist in interpreting the results correctly. Without doing EDA you will not understand your data fully.\n",

    "- The model outputs probabilities that can be converted to binary outcomes. \n",
    "- Coefficients show how each predictor variable influences the likelihood of the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Measures:\n",
    "- Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.\n",

    "### Types of Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Logistic Regression\n",
    "Binary logistic regression is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome, such as \n",
    "- yes or no, \n",
    "- true or false, or \n",
    "- 0 or 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it could be used to:\n",
    "- predict whether a customer will churn or not, \n",
    "- predict whether a patient has a disease or not, or \n",
    "- predict whether a loan will be repaid or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multinomial Logistic Regression\n",
    "Multinomial logistic regression is used to predict the probability of one of three or more possible outcomes, such as \n",
    "- the type of product a customer will buy, \n",
    "- the rating a customer will give a product, or \n",
    "- the political party a person will vote for.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ordinal Logistic Regression\n",
    "Used to predict the probability of an outcome that falls into a predetermined order, such as \n",
    "- the level of customer satisfaction, \n",
    "- the severity of a disease, or \n",
    "- the stage of cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between Linear and Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The core difference lies in their target predictions.\n",
    "- Linear regression excels at predicting continuous values along a spectrum. \n",
    "    - resulting output would be a specific amount, a continuous value on the amount scale.\n",
    "- Linear regression answers “how much” questions, providing a specific value on a continuous scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression deals with categories. \n",
    "    - It doesn’t predict a specific value but rather the likelihood of something belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "    - output here would be a probability between 0 (not likely spam) and 1 (very likely spam). \n",
    "    - This probability is then used to assign an email to a definitive category (spam or not spam) based on a chosen threshold.\n",
    "- Logistic regression tackles “yes or no” scenarios, giving the probability of something belonging to a certain category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "- The medical institute, we want to identify the likelihood of patients being readmitted within 30 days of discharge based on patient \n",
    "    - demographics, \n",
    "    - medical history, \n",
    "    - length of stay (LOS), and \n",
    "    - clinical metrics such as blood pressure, \n",
    "    - blood glucose levels, and \n",
    "    - medication adherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Assumptions of Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Specific\n",
    "- Binary Outcome: The dependent variable is binary.\n",
    "    - Logistic regression is designed for binary dependent variables. \n",
    "    - If your outcome has more than two categories, you might need a multinomial logistic regression or other classification techniques.\n",
    "- Independence of Observations: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "    -  This means no repeated measurements or clustering within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Between Variables\n",
    "- Linearity of Log-Odds: There is a linear relationship between the log-odds of the outcome and the independent variables.\n",
    "    - Outcome itself has a relationship with log-odds.\n",
    "    - Outcome does not have linear relationship with the independent variables.\n",
    "- No Multicollinearity: Independent variables are not highly correlated.\n",
    "    - Multicollinearity can cause instability in the model and make it difficult to interpret the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other\n",
    "- Large Sample Size: Logistic regression performs well with larger datasets.\n",
    "    - To ensure reliable parameter estimates.\n",
    "- Absence of Outliers: outliers can significantly influence the model. \n",
    "    - It’s important to check for and address any outliers that might distort the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Define the Problem**\n",
    "- Target Variable: Readmission within 30 days (1 = Yes, 0 = No).\n",
    "- Predictors:\n",
    "    - Patient Demographics: Age, gender, insurance status.\n",
    "    - Clinical Metrics: Blood glucose levels, blood pressure, medication adherence.\n",
    "    - Hospital Metrics: Length of Stay (LOS), number of previous visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Collect and Prepare Data**\n",
    "- Gather historical patient data and ensure it's clean and consistent.\n",
    "    - Check for Missing Data:\n",
    "    - Impute missing values for predictors like glucose levels using median or mean.\n",
    "    - Standardize Continuous Variables:\n",
    "    - Standardize LOS, glucose levels, and blood pressure for consistency."
